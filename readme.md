# Welcome!

This is a repo to show my final project for one of my favorite classes for my master's degree in data science at Buffalo State, Statistics Applications to Data Science with R. We were instructed to find a dataset, think of a hypothesis to explore, and demonstrate our statistical skills to address the hypothesis using R. My work and findings are published at the accompanying GitHub page.

## About the Dataset

The dataset for this project comes from a study that explored the impact of media use on attention span, mental health, and academic performance in children 8 to 12 years old. The study was published in 2020 and explores three different methods of media: total hours consumed, hours of video game play, and total media types used at the same time. Specializing in early education and childcare, I work as a data scientist in the software development industry. I thought this study sounded not only interesting but extremely relevant to my work, and I admire the thoroughness of their data collection and documentation methods.

## Goals for the Project

For this project, I dug into some of the variables collected as part of the study and attempt to fit a few different models based on what we learned in class. I tried and answer the question: “Which factors seem to have an impact on the mental health of young children and is there anything we can do about it?” I am additionally interested in the different perspectives of the students collected from the teachers, parents, and even self-reports from the students.
